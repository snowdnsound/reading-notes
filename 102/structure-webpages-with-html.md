# Structure Webpages with HTML

## Wireframing 

Wireframing is a practice used by designers which allows them to determine and plan the information hierarchy of their for a website, app or product. A wireframe focuses on how the designer wants the user to process information on the project. It also allows you to quickly try different ways of how the user interacts with the project, without the distraction of color or fonts. 

## Examples

* Drawn on paper or whiteboard, easy to change
* Paper protoypes allow you to test every stage
* Software, which allows you to track detailed decisions

## Things to Consider

The right wireframe process depends on what the particular situation requires. If visual design is unimportant, then you can go from sketch to code. However, if time and business value is high, then taking the time to do hi-def wireframe, cycle of testing and fully realized prototype makes sense. 

* Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
* Sketch > Code
* Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-def Wireframe > Visual > Code
* Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code
