# Design web pages with CSS



## Tips

* Chrome, right click Inspect > developer tools
* Other elements can nest inside an anchor tag, like an image

## Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is how you style your website, by controling how your HTML elements look in the browser. There are three different ways you can write CSS

* Internal - Seperate CSS file connected to HTML
* External - CSS is built into the HTML file
* Inline - CSS is built into the HTML, element itself


We use classes & ID selectors to grab (select) the HTML elements.

selector {propterty: value,}
or  
selector {
    property: value;
}

selector {
    property: value;
}

selector {
    property: value;
    property: value;
    property: value;
}

## Positioning 

Static, relative, absolute & fixed
