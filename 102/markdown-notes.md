# Outline of Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for generating formatting to plaintext documents. It is made up of symbols to style and structure text.

## Why do we use Markdown?

HTML gives significant control but slows down authoring. Markdown is simple, can be used for everything and since it is universal, it allows you to easily transfer it to a varity of publishing locations.

- It is also future proof unlike some **proprietary** word document files! 

## What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
The "pound" or "hashtag" symbol, whatever you call ---> **"#"**

## How many do you need to create the largest heading?
Just one. 

## How many do you need to create the smallest heading?
Six of them.

## When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
It is a best practice to use the asterisk "*" symbol. Two for bold, or one for italicized, on each side of what you want to affect. 

## How do you create a link with Markdown?
Place the word you want to link in brackets "[link]" and then place the URL to link to in parentheses "(www.google.com)"
It will look like so:

[link](www.google.com)

## What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
You can use:

- a dash "-"
- an asterisk "*"
- a plus "+"
