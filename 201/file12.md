# Chart.js, Canvas

## Setup

The first thing to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script (commented out):

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>
 <meta charset="utf-8" />
 <title>Chart.js demo</title>
 <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>
 </head>
 <body>
 </body>
</html> -->

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.
