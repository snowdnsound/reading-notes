# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM




## JavaScript Objects Basics

An object is a collection of related date and/or functionality. Usually they consist of several varibales and functions. As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins with defining and initializing a variable.

## Introduction to the DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. The core DOM is built using multiple APIs that work together. The core DOM defines the entities describing any document and the objects within it.

## Questions from the Reading

### JavaScript Objects

How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

* It is a collection of data that is useful together, that you can recall to do handy things. 

What are some advantages to creating object literals?

* It's easier to transfer related data items, especially a request to a server to be put in a database. 

How do objects differ from arrays?

* They are easier to work with when you want to identify objects by name 

Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

* If an object property name is held in a variable, you need to use bracket notation. 

Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

* The this keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside. It is more useful when you only have to create a single object literal. 


### Intro to the DOM

What is the DOM?

* The data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. It's a programming interface for web documents.

Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

*  Without the DOM, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts. The DOM represents the page and JavaScript the programming of the page.
