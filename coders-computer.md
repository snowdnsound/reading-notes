# The Command Line

The Command Line (CL) is another name for that black box called Termainal that you may have entered commands into or see runnign in the background. It's a text based interface to a system where you can put in commands and it prints out feedback. Don't think of it as leaving the GUI behind, but more like adding to it. You can have as many command line windows open as you want, running tasks **simultaneously.** Typically you might have three windows open. 

- One for doing work in
- One for viewing ancillary data
- One for viewing manual pages
