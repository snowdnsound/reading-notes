## Growth Mindset to Me is a Gateway
> "One that unlocks the potential to learning things not thought possible. It is something that challenges doubt, your own personal biases, and allows new realities to exist." -*Justin Benjamin*

### Here Are 3 Remidners That Help Keep Me in a Growth Mindset:
* No one is good at it when just beginning.
* It's meant to be hard, we grow by challenging ourselves.
* There was a time when "they" couldn't either. How'd they get to where they are now.
